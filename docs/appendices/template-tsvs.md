## Template TSVs for metadata submission
* * *

This folder contains all potential entities that could be submitted to the Gen3 data model. Some of the entities are optional.

You can find a complete and detailed description of the new data dictionary [here](https://data.gen3.org/DD).

A project will need to be created and you need to be [granted submitter access](../data-contribution/#3-receive-project-name-api-credentials) before you submit everything under a project.  You will start your submission from `study.tsv`.
