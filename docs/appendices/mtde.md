# Minimum Technical Data Elements (MTDE)
* * *

To facilitate cross analysis and improve the usability of the Gen3 commons, all data contributors should submit what are considered the “Minimum Technical Data Elements”.   These pre-analytic fields were determined through an iterative series of conversations with data contributors and the Gen3 “Data Experience” group.  

For example, if a data commons was designed to accept gene/genome sequences, in order to facilitate analysis of genetic data across studies submitted by different groups, a node called "submitted aligned reads" may require the following metadata properties (MTDE) labeled as "Required: Yes":
