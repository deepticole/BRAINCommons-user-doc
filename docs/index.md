<h3> Overview </h3>

The Gen3 commons allows approved researchers access to raw unprocessed datasets in a scalable, reproducible, privacy and security protected manner.

<h3> Mission </h3>

The Gen3 commons was developed to accelerate scientific discovery through creation of a collaborative infrastructure that enables sharing of information between stakeholders in industry, academia, and regulatory agencies.

Gen3 is managed by the Center for Data Intensive Science (CDIS) at the University of Chicago.

For more information visit:  [CDIS Guiding Principles](https://cdis.uchicago.edu/guiding-principles)

<h3> Support </h3>
Operation of the Gen3 commons is supported by generous grants from Amazon Web Services' [Grants for Research Credit Program](https://aws.amazon.com/research-credits/) and Microsoft Azure's [Research Grant Program](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/microsoft-azure-for-research/).

## The Data Commons Architecture

***

User access to the Gen3 data commons runs through a VPC or Virtual Private Cloud.   Access to data and analysis tools through a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) allows for balance of usability and security.   All access is through a monitored head node.  Data is not directly accessed from the Internet.  

Other secure and compliant Gen3 member systems (including cloud based systems) can access Gen3 data through the API.
