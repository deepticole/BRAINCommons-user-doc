## Why Do Gen3 Commons Use a Data Model?
* Having all participating members use the same data model:
    * Allows for standardized metadata elements across a commons.
    * Permits flexible and scaleable API generation based on data commons software that reads the data model schema.   
    * Lets users query the commons API so that an ecosystem of applications can be built.
    * Helps automate the validation of submitted data.

For the most current model, go to: https://github.com/occ-data/gen3dictionary
For the most current graph of the model, go to: https://www.gen3.org/data-group/

If you have an submission element that you believe can't be described in the model, we'd be glad to work with you to find a home for the element or update the model.
