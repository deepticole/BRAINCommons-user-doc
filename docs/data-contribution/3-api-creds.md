# 3. Receive project name and API access credentials

&nbsp;
Once you have completed the [data inventory form, link to step](link), you will receive an email with your project name (associated with project data), username (used to login to Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) headnode), and instructions to access the metadata submission portal and an object storage for your project.  
&nbsp;
The project name will be used to create the project node from which you can build out the rest of your submission and is an essential identifier. For example, the project name will need to be provided when you [submit the metadata, link to metadata submission](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn8011461/wiki/413154) for your experiment nodes.

## Project name example
```
<mycompanyname>_P0001_T1
<mycompanyname>_P0002_T1
<mycompanyname>_P0001_T2
```
### Breakdown:
* "<mycompanyname>" identifies the submitter organization
* "P000x" identifies the submission number for said organization in said train
* "Tx" identifies the train number
&nbsp;
NOTE:  the Gen3 data submission calendar is broken up into different trains.
NOTE2:   Your project folder will have a prefix appended to it to identify the commons.  eg - BloodPAC (BPA):
```
"BPA_<mycompanyname>_P0001_T1"
```
